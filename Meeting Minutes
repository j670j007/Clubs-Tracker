Weekly team meeting 1/28/25:

In attendance:  Amil, Elizabeth, Jennifer, Justin, and Michelle

We started with introductions.  Everyone on the team described their area of expertise, which is a combination of front-end and backend experience.  

We also discussed roles and expectations for this semester, including distribution of labor.  Jennifer will handle the database portion of this project, including building the MySQL database. Amil will work on the backend, including the integration of the frontend with the database.
Elizabeth and Michelle will work on the front end interface. Justin will do a combination of front and backend.  

We decided that our team project for this semester will be a club tracker app.  The app will be web-based, and built using React, Python, Flask, with a MYSQL database to handle user login info.  Users would be able to sign in and administer clubs they are members of, with different permissions for members.  We are also planning to include event information and budget tracking as features of the app.

The majority of the meeting was spent working on the requirements document.  We came up with 20 different requirements, and assigned story points for each.  The requirements were a combination of front-end and backend items.  

We decided tentatively on meeting weekly via Zoom at 6:00 p.m. on Tuesdays, but this is subject to change if the time doesn't work for everyone.

Weekly team meeting 2/4/25:

In attendance:  Amil, Jennifer, Justin, and Michelle

We talked about deliverables for this Sunday.  We need the architecture document to reflect what we are going to build.  

We need something for authentication - User ID/password, e-mail.  These will be added to the Users table.  You will be able to self-register, and won't necessarily need to be added to a club right away.    

Under Clubs, add an invite code.  This way a registered user can join a club.

Merging Club_Members and Members table, making sure to keep the Admin flag on the Members table.  We are not adding specific permissions at this time, but are keeping track of admins using this flag.  

Once Jennifer has built the database, she will export it and place on Git.

For the architecture document, Jennifer will add the database schema and the update statements.  Anil will put togther the front-end portion of this document.  
  
We discussed Sprint 1.  All the database tables are added for that, then the user login/authentication.  We will use a session token for authentication instead of a global variable.  .  

We divided up the work on the artifacts, with Jennifer doing the database portion and Anil, Elizabeth, Michelle, and Justin completing the remaining items.    

We will need to ask a few questions of the TA, with regards to whether the requirements list is set in stone.  Also what is acceptable for the documentation to turn in Sunday.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weekly team meeting 3/4/25:

In attendance:  Anil, Elizabeth, Jennifer, Justin, Michelle

Meeting to talk about the video.  

How do we want to approach making the video?  Structure-wise, we need 8-10 of video, followed by 5 min. of Q/A.  Since there are 5 of us, Anil suggested someone doing an introduction, someone doing a demo, someone else doing the conclusion.  Everyone can submit their own recording.  

Jennifer asked about whether we are talking about the technical piece of this. Anil said that would be included in the demo portion of the presentation.

For the introduction, it's supposed to be about a minute long, just a high level overview.  What the project does.   

We decided to meet to record all together rather than each person doing their part separately.  
Anil set he would put up a recording of the application running on Google Drive.  Michelle said we should split up who talks about what.  

Anil said we would set up a Google Doc with talking points, and each person can talk about a different thing.  Anil said people can talk separately, we'll overlay the voice.  Maybe also have some time expectations for each point.  

For introduction, we can record our name, as well as a more formal introduction.  
Visually, we'll just have a blank page while we go over the introduction.  

Weekly team meeting: 3/11/25
